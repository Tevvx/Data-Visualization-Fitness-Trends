Project Overview
This project focuses on performing a deep-dive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the CardioGood Fitness dataset to uncover demographic trends and purchasing behavior across three treadmill product lines: the TM195, TM498, and TM798. The analysis aims to provide data-driven insights for targeted marketing and product positioning.

**Key Data Science Workflows**
Data Wrangling: Conducted extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure a high-quality dataset, resulting in the production of cleaned_cardio_good_fitness.csv.

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Examined individual variables (Age, Income, Education) and their relationships to identify core customer segments.

Statistical Visualization: Leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib to create heatmaps, boxplots, and pairplots to visualize correlations between physical fitness levels and socioeconomic factors.

Customer Profiling: Segmented users based on treadmill model preference, revealing distinct profiles such as "High-Income Fitness Enthusiasts" (TM798) versus "Budget-Conscious Starters" (TM195).

**Key Findings**
Income Correlation: Higher household income is a strong predictor for the purchase of the premium TM798 model.

Fitness Rating: Customers who self-rated their fitness as '5' (high) predominantly chose the TM798, while the TM195 is the most popular choice for entry-level users.

Demographic Trends: The analysis identifies specific age ranges and education levels that correlate most strongly with treadmill usage frequency.
